First of all, you have to make a few changes in the application.properties file. If you are using the postgreSQL then you should type your url accordingly. If you are using another database, write accordingly.

For example, in postgreSQL with Demo database name: jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/Demo

This will only work if postgreSQL is in default settings.

Then, change the username and password.

If you don't want the data to be lost every time you run the app, you can use update instead of create-drop.

And that's it. If you have http knowledge, you can use it easily now.

Have a nice try!
